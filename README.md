## 🦊 What is Rez Hive?

**Rez Hive** is not a chatbot. It is a **Cognitive Operating System (COS)**. It provides a sovereign layer between your hardware and your intent.

Unlike cloud AI (ChatGPT, Claude), Rez Hive is:
*   **Sovereign:** No API keys. No cloud. Your data never leaves your machine.
*   **Multimodal:** It can **Think** (Logic), **See** (Vision), and **Act** (Execution).
*   **Self-Evolving:** It can rewrite its own rules via the **Mutation Worker**.
*   **Safe:** A **Constitutional Governor** enforces your rules and prevents dangerous actions.

## 🏛️ Architecture

The system operates on the **O.K.I.R.U. Protocol** (Observe → Kernelize → Integrate → Rez → Upgrade).

### The Trinity (Verified Operational)

| Organ | Worker | Model | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brain** | `Code Worker` | Llama 3.2 3B | Logic, coding, math, reasoning. |
| **Eyes** | `Vision Worker` | Llava 7B | Screenshots, UI analysis, OCR. |
| **Hands** | `App Worker` | PowerShell | OS control (Launch apps, manage files). |

### The Sovereign Council

| Worker | Role | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Director** | Compiles ideas into **SCE JSON** blueprints for media generation. | ✅ Active |
| **Mutation** | Writes new laws into the `rezonic_index.json` (Memory). | ✅ Active |
| **Memory** | The "BIOS" that hydrates context on every boot. | ✅ Active |
| **File Worker** | Safe file system operations in sandboxed workspace. | ✅ Active |
| **MCP Worker** | Web search and browser automation (mock-ready). | ✅ Active |
